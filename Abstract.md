## Problem

Insurance coverage and mental health have been a huge top in the U.S. as of late. Our team has been tasked with 

## Methodology

* Data was scraped fron the CDC's BRFSS via a combination of Socrate and request API's
Logistical regressions

## Findings

* The southeast portion of the U.S. has a lower perceived quality of life relative to the rest of the U.S. 
* Some regions of the U.S. despite having higher levels of perceived health, experience recent physical and/or mental difficulties that interfere with everyday life.
* Recent bouts with mental health can be used to predict insured status.
* Recent bouts with mental health can also predict lack of insurance coverage in the past 12 months. 
* The predictive models generated small increases in predictive power. Low data quality limited the potential of the classification models.

## Recommendations 

* Transition BRFSS to an online format
    * provides more perceived anonymity increasing the possibility of honest and complete responses
* Incentivize response
    * tax credit of $50 to $100
        * may increase participant pool
        * research to gauge the need for an incentive should be done to determin feasbility and need
* Complete an examination of disparities between perceived general health in relation to recent physical/mental health issues
